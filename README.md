# INSO4101_Team09

Progress in the implementation of the phase 2 code:
Started a new project using react as our main web platform. The first spec carried out was to look for a simple database to incorporate into the project and that above all is free for the development of our website. In this video we are using a data table in notion to store future users of our website. It uses the http and @notionhq/client modules of node.js to create a server which can read and send information to notion and receive it in react.
